                <li>
                    <b>Why will people come to your site?</b>
                </li>
                    <p>Visitors will come to evaluate my suitability for potential employment. They are likely to be employers, recruiters, or professionals seeking to collaborate or network with me. By showcasing my skills, achievements, and projects, my website acts as an interactive resume, providing a comprehensive overview of my capabilities. It allows visitors to assess my expertise, style, and compatibility, which can impact their decision.</p>
                <li>
                    <b>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</b>

                            <b>What are my skills and qualifications?</b> <p>They can find information about my education, certifications, and training. Highlighting my what I know helps visitors determine whether or not I possess the skills for their needs. Obviously, my qualifications and personal page will grow as I continue my educational path.</p>

Highlighting work I have been involved in can provide insights into my practical abilities and problem-solving skills.</p>
                        </li>        
                        <li>

                <li>
                    <b>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</b>
                </li>
                    <p>They may want to assess my skills and qualifications to determine whether I have the expertise they are seeking. They also may spend time reviewing my project portfolio, download a copy of my resume and have the ability to contact me through easily accessible information, such as an email address or contact form.</p>
                <li>
                    <b>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</b>
                </li>
                    <p>The information I will provide will be uniquely linked to me and no other service. They will come to it, to gain the information they seek about me, who is someone they have previously encountered through other means. Only I can provide the information they are looking for.</p>
