                      <b>What are my skills and qualifications?</b> 
                      <p>As I continue my education, this page will host current personal projects and school associated assignments. There is a link in the side bar navigation under Quick Links to take you through my progression in my Web Fundamentals class.</p>

                    <li>
                      <b>What projects have I worked on?</b> 
                      <p>In my Programming with Functions class, I am in the process of making a GUI/Tk interface that features a Quilting Calculator that will return four calculations. It is the building blocks for an app that I've been thinking about for over a year. To date, the program I want to make doesn't exist and will post a progression of that and other projects, I work on.</p>

                      <b>Based on Merit</b>
                      <p>Currently I am holding onto a 4.0 gpa in all my courses. I have been working hard to gain the understanding needed. It hasn't been easy. Going back to school has been challenging, but also very rewarding. As a full time working adult, there have been sacrifices made to reach my goals. I work hard for everything I want and that reflects in life and work ethics.</p>
