    <h2>Name - Kimberly Miner</h2>
    <h2>Nickname - Kimah</h2>

    <p>Hi, my name is Kim but a lot of people call me Kimah. It has been my online name since making my first email address in 1997. I am a 50 year old mother and wife. I've been married for 6.5 years to a wonderful man named Tyler who loves to make me laugh and we have a beautiful blended family with ages ranging from 11 all the way to 23. I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints all of my life.</p>
    
    <p>I grew up playing video games and am a quintissential Gen-Xer. I was around when MTV was actually good and was always into the latest technology available. The 80's was the best decade and gave us some of the greatest music(alternative), pop culture and fashion.</p>
    
    <p> I am currently a commercial embroiderer and decorate hats and clothing for a living. While I am very good at what I do and it has paid the bills, I am growing weary of it and saw the disadvantages of getting stuck in a job that doesn't go anywhere. It will never make me rich and it will always provide the same outcome. I am ready for a new outcome and new adventure in my life.</p>

    <p>Something fun about me and this course is that I used to make GeoCities webpages when the internet was still dial up and css was embedded in the code. I actually remember a lot of what I did and am excited to do more than make Jimmy Buffet and Xena fan pages, putting my skills to the test and expanding my knowledge. </p>
